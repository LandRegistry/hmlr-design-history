# HM Land Registry Design History
A collaborative space for documenting and sharing our design work on GOV.UK services.

## Purpose of this Design History
This website serves as a central hub for HM Land Registry designers to:
* Document and showcase our design work
* Share progress and decisions with stakeholders
* Reflect on our design journey and iterations

## How to Use This Design History

### Creating a New Category
* If you need to add a new category (effectively a new service) to the site, seek approval from design leads before proceeding.
* New categories should represent significant service areas or projects.

### Creating a New Post
1. Ensure your post will be in the correct service category.
2. Find an existing post that's similar to what you want to create.
3. Copy its Markdown file and use it as a template.
4. Modify the content to fit your new design story.

### Writing Your Post
* Use Markdown for formatting. See the Markdown resources below for guidance.
* Posts written in markdown will automatically be converted to HTML and published on the site.
* It is recommeneded to write in the voice of the team, not as an individual.
* At the end of the post, credit the team members involved in the project.
* Integrate images within your text to tell a cohesive story.
* Before publishing, have other designers review the post. Multiple perspectives can catch oversights and improve quality.

### Adding Images
* Place images directly where you want them in your post.
* Use Markdown image syntax: `![Alt text](path/to/image.jpg "Optional title")`

### Publishing Your Post
* Once you're happy with your post and it has been reviewed, submit it for publication.

## Important Notes
* This site automatically converts your Markdown into HTML, making it easy to focus on content.
* Please do not make changes to the site's CSS or structure without approval from design leads.
