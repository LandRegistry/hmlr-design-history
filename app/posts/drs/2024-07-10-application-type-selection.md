## Background

Following the broader work on [Transactions](/drs/transactions/), the team redirected its focus to a critical pain point in the same user journey: the application type selection page. This shift in priority was driven by the need to address the high rate of cancellations and retakes (CRTIs) caused by incorrect application type selection.

## The challenge

The application type selection process in DRS was causing several issues:

1. Users were frequently selecting incorrect application types, leading to misrouted applications and CRTIs.
2. The existing options were confusing and often misinterpreted by users.
3. The page lacked clear guidance to help users make the correct selection.
4. The high error rate was causing significant inefficiencies for both users and HM Land Registry.

## Our approach

To address these challenges, the UCD team adopted a focused and user-centred approach:

1. **Data analysis**: We examined the existing data on CRTIs to understand the most common errors in application type selection.

2. **User research**: We conducted in-depth interviews with DRS Champions and users to gain insights into their decision-making process when selecting application types.

3. **Collaborative design**: We worked closely with subject matter experts, content designers, and developers to create clearer options and more intuitive user flows.

4. **Iterative prototyping**: We developed and refined multiple prototypes based on user feedback and testing results.

## What we did

### Simplifying options

Based on our research and data analysis, we redesigned the application type selection page to present users with clearer, more distinct options:

1. Change of ownership
2. Updating specific title details
3. Registering a new lease
4. Extending a lease

We used plain language and provided clear examples for each option to help users make the correct selection.

### Adding confirmation screens

To further reduce errors, we introduced confirmation screens for each application type. These screens:

1. Provided more detailed information about the selected application type.
2. Listed common scenarios and forms associated with the application type.
3. Included GDS UI components to highlight important information and potential pitfalls.

### Improving content and guidance

We worked closely with subject matter experts to:

1. Simplify complex terminology while maintaining legal accuracy.
2. Create clear, concise descriptions for each application type.
3. Develop helpful guidance content to support users in making the correct selection.

### Iterative testing and refinement

We conducted multiple rounds of user testing with a diverse group of participants, including:

1. Experienced conveyancers
2. Novice users
3. DRS Champions

This iterative process allowed us to continuously refine our designs based on real user feedback and behaviour.

## Challenges and solutions

### Balancing simplicity and comprehensiveness

We struggled to find the right balance between simplifying the options and ensuring all necessary information was included. Our solution was to use a two-step approach: simplified options on the initial page, followed by more detailed confirmation screens.

### Addressing diverse user needs

Different user groups had varying levels of familiarity with HM Land Registry terminology. We addressed this by using plain language wherever possible and providing additional context and examples on the confirmation screens.

### Technical constraints

Some of our initial design ideas were challenging to implement due to technical limitations. We worked closely with developers to find creative solutions that balanced user needs with technical feasibility.

## Outcomes and lessons

As the developers are currently implementing these changes, it's too early to report definitive results. However, based on our research and testing, we are anticipating:

1. A significant reduction in CRTIs related to incorrect application type selection.
2. Improved user satisfaction with the clarity and ease of use of the new design.
3. Increased efficiency for HM Land Registry processing applications.

### Key lessons learned:

1. **The power of simplification**: Reducing complexity in the initial selection process, whilst providing detailed information at later stages, proved highly effective in user testing.
2. **Importance of confirmation steps**: Adding confirmation screens significantly reduced the potential for errors in our prototype by giving users a chance to verify their selection  before proceeding any further.
3. **Value of iterative testing**: Regular user testing throughout the design process was crucial in creating a user-friendly solution.
4. **Cross-functional collaboration**: Close collaboration between UCD, subject matter experts, and developers was essential in creating a solution that was both user-friendly and technically feasible.
5. **Precision in option presentation**: We learned the importance of presenting clear, distinct options. By avoiding overly broad categories and ensuring each option is specific and easily distinguishable, we can significantly reduce user confusion and the likelihood of incorrect selections, thereby minimising CRTIs.
## Next steps

With the implementation of these improvements underway, our focus now shifts to:

1. Monitoring the impact of these changes on CRTI rates over the coming months.
2. Conducting a comprehensive analysis of the actual impact once sufficient data is available.
3. Exploring the possibility of extending this approach to other areas of the DRS journey.
4. Continuing to gather user feedback to identify any remaining pain points or areas for improvement.
5. Investigating the potential for implementing more advanced features, such as AI-assisted guidance, in future iterations.
